        <strong>Instructions</strong>
        <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">
            <ol>
                <li>Combine all ingredients in a large bowl, stir until combined, cover, and let rest for 15-20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Knead dough for 3-5 minutes until smooth, then let it rise in the bowl until it grows in size by 25-50%, about 30-60 minutes.</li>
                <li>Divide dough into two equal pieces, form each into a ball, and place them into spacious containers. Cover and refrigerate for 12-48 hours. (For same-day baking, leave at room temperature).</li>
                <li>Bring dough to room temperature and ensure it has grown at least 2X in size.</li>
                <li>Shape each dough ball into a 9” roll: flatten into a 1/2” thick triangle, roll from the narrow end, and close off the seam.</li>
                <li>Place rolls on parchment sprinkled with cornmeal, cover with a damp towel, and let them rise.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425F.</li>
                <li>Bake rolls when they have doubled in size and spring back slowly when poked: 12 minutes with steam, then 4-6 minutes without steam, rotating halfway.</li>
                <li>Let rolls cool (30-60 minutes) and place them in a plastic bag for at least 3-4 hours before cutting.</li>
            </ol>
